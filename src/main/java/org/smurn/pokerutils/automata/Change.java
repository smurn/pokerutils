/**
 * Describes one or more modifications of a table.
 * <h3>Granularity</h3>
 * <p>
 * When designing implementations of this interface there is always a choice of
 * granularity. One can design for many small changes or one big change.
 * </p><p>
 * A change should never 'jump' over an action of a player. If the player makes
 * a desision then there should not be a change that performs modifications
 * that happend before and after that decision.
 * </p><p>
 * If there is a potential waiting period between two modifications, they should
 * be separated into individiual changes.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Information content</h3>
 * <p>
 * Each change must at least contain all the information required to apply it.
 * Otherwise the {@link #apply(org.smurn.pokerutils.Table)} method cannot
 * be implemented.
 * </p><p>
 * Furthermore it should contain the information required to describe the
 * 'relevant' aspects of the change. Even if this information could be derived
 * from the input table. An example is {@link GetUpChange} which includes
 * the player that left, even if that could easily received from the table.
 * But for log messages knowing player who left is very relevant. Without it
 * the log function would require the table in addition to the change. The 
 * goal is to have self-contained changes.
 * </p>
